# ðŸ”° Introduction and Welcome

**Introduction and Welcome:**

Welcome to the K8SUG CTL - Hands-on Workshop at NAB titled **"Optimizing K8S Cluster Autoscaling with Karpenter: Cost-Efficiency and Reliability."** In todayâ€™s session, weâ€™ll dive into Karpenter, an open-source cluster autoscaler designed to scale Kubernetes workloads efficiently and reliably.

Our target audience includes **Managers, CTOs, DevOps Engineers, Platform Engineers**, and members of the **Kubernetes and Cloud Native community**. Whether youâ€™re focused on reducing operational costs or improving the resilience and reliability of your clusters, this workshop is designed to provide valuable insights and hands-on experience.

#### Agenda Overview:

Throughout this hands-on workshop, youâ€™ll learn how to leverage **Karpenter** to optimise your **EKS clusters** for cost and performance. By the end of this session, you will:

* **Gain a deep understanding** of Karpenterâ€™s integration with EKS.
* Learn to **configure Karpenter** for cost-effective **NodePools** and **NodeClasses**.
* Implement strategies for **resource optimisation**, which will help reduce operational costs.
* Acquire practical skills in **monitoring**, **testing**, and **configuring** Karpenter with real-world scenarios.

Weâ€™ll begin with setting up the workshop environment, including AWS Lab access, navigating the AWS console, and bootstrapping the EKS cluster. As the environment is set up, weâ€™ll discuss **Cluster Autoscaling 101**, the difference between the native AWS autoscaler and Karpenter, and cover the historical context of AWSâ€™s adoption of Karpenter through the CNCF.

Once the environment is ready, we will move forward with testing default settings, followed by advanced configurations to unlock **cost-saving opportunities** such as **Spot Instances** and **Custom Subnet** management, while monitoring it using **Grafana and Prometheus**.

At the end of the workshop, youâ€™ll be able to confidently apply **best practices** in **NodeClass** and **NodePool management**, ensuring your infrastructure is both reliable and cost-efficient.

#### Hands-On Activities Include:

1. **EKS Cluster and Workshop Tool Setup**:
   * AWS Lab access and console navigation.
   * Karpenter, Prometheus, and Grafana installation.
2. **Cluster Autoscaling Concepts**:
   * Deep dive into **NodePools** and **NodeClasses**.
   * Testing the default configurations with auto-scaling events (scale-up and scale-down).
3. **Advanced Configuration Scenarios**:
   * **Scenario 1**: Cutting costs with **Spot Instances**.
   * **Scenario 2**: Managing **Custom Subnets** for more tailored configurations.
4. **Testing and Monitoring**:
   * Load tests to trigger autoscaling and monitor **Grafana dashboards**.
5. **Wrap-Up and Cleanup**:
   * Guidance on cleaning up AWS resources after the session.
   * Q\&A to clarify any remaining questions.

***

#### Workshop Prerequisites:

* A laptop with internet connectivity.
* Basic knowledge of **Kubernetes** and **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**.
* Access to the **AWS Console**.
* A basic understanding of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles.
